I tried 5 times to finish this assignment and it's still not the perfect one lol. I was able to get most of the way through the assignment, but got stucked several times, so it was back and forth.
I don't know why it keeps telling me "i" is already defined. The only thing I know how to make a change is the color...
Can't wait to challenge the next assignment
